## ✩ Level 1: Core Understanding & Syntax Practice (Q1–Q15)

Focus: Data types, operators, flow control, type casting, variables

1. Write a program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.

2. Check if a number is even or odd using ternary operator.

3. Write a program to print the ASCII value of a character.

4. Calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle using user input.

5. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

6. Check if a year is a leap year or not.

7. Find the largest of three numbers using nested `if`.

8. Check if a number is prime.

9. Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

10. Find factorial of a number using both loop and recursion.

11. Reverse a number.

12. Check if a number is a palindrome.

13. Find the sum of digits of a number.

14. Print Fibonacci series up to N terms.

15. Check if a number is an Armstrong number.

## ✩ Level 2: Strings, Loops, and Logic Building (Q16–Q30)

Focus: Strings, StringBuffer, loop nesting, conditional logic

16. Count vowels, consonants, digits, and white spaces in a string.

17. Check if a string is a palindrome.

18. Reverse a string using `StringBuffer` and manually using loops.

19. Remove all white spaces from a string.

20. Check if two strings are anagrams.

21. Count the occurrence of each character in a string.

22. Print the frequency of each word in a sentence.

23. Find the longest word in a sentence.

24. Replace all vowels in a string with `*`.

25. Toggle the case of each character in a string.

26. Sort characters in a string in ascending order.

27. Find duplicate characters in a string.

28. Compress a string (e.g., aabbbcc → a2b3c2).

29. Check if a string contains only digits.

30. Write a method that returns true if two strings are rotations of each other.

## ✩ Level 3: Object-Oriented Concepts (Q31–Q40)

Focus: Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism

31. Create a class `Student` with fields name, roll, and marks. Write methods to accept and display details.

32. Implement a bank account system with deposit and withdraw methods using encapsulation.

33. Create a class hierarchy: `Shape` → `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`. Use inheritance and override area methods.

34. Create a class `Person`. Derive `Employee` from it. Add salary and department. Use constructors.

35. Demonstrate constructor overloading with a `Box` class (length, width, height).

36. Demonstrate method overloading with a `Calculator` class.

37. Use `super` to invoke the parent class constructor.

38. Create an abstract class `Vehicle` with abstract method `move()`. Implement in `Car` and `Bike`.

39. Demonstrate the use of `final` keyword with a class, method, and variable.

40. Write a program to show dynamic method dispatch (runtime polymorphism).

## ✩ Level 4: Advanced Logic & Modifiers (Q41–50)

Focus: Modifiers, access control, static blocks, complex logic

41. Demonstrate access specifiers (private, protected, default, public) using a package.

42. Create a class with a `static` block and explain its execution order.

43. Write a static method to find the GCD of two numbers.

44. Use the `Scanner` class to take input for a 2D array and print it.

45. Create a utility class with all methods static to handle string utilities (reverse, vowel count, etc.).

46. Create a mini student grading system with marks as input and grade as output.

47. Simulate a login system with max 3 attempts using loops and conditions.

48. Create a simple `Book` management class with methods to add, search, and list books.

49. Create a program to detect duplicate elements in an array of integers.

50. Implement a mini calculator with switch-case that performs basic operations: +, -, *, /, %, and exit.
