# Modifiers

- These are the *reserved* **keywords** present in Java, which will be used to provide <u>functionality</u> or <u>decide accessibility area</u> of `class`, `method` and `variable`.

- There are **2** types of **Modifier**:
  
  - *Access* modifier.
  
  - *Non-access* modifier.
  
  ![]()

## Access Modifier

- *Decides* accessibility area of `class`, `method` and `variable`.

### public

- When a `class` or `method` or `variable` as **public**, it can be accessed *within the class*, *outside the class*, *within the package* and *outside the package*.
  
  - But, the `class` has to be **imported**. 

## Package

- **Collection** of several `classes` and `interfaces`.

- To enable communication between two different packages, `import` is used.

- **Syntax:** `import package_name.class_name;`
