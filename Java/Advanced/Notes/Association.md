# Has-A Relationship

### Problems with Is-A Relationship

- A class can directly inherit from a single class only.
- In inheritance, all properties of the parent class are present in the child class irrespective of requirement and usage.

## Association

- The act of an *independent object* **accessing** another *independent object* is known as an association.
  - This relationship is referred to as *Object_1* **Has-A-Relation** with *Object_2*.

```java
class Driver {
    Car c = new Car();

    void drive() {
        c.start();
        c.accelerate();
        c.stop();
    }
}

class Car {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Started.");
    }
    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Accelerating...");
    }
    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Stopped.");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Driver d = new Driver();
        d.c = null;
        d.drive(); // NullPointerException on c.start();
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Driver d = new Driver();
        d = null;
        d.drive(); // NullPointerException
    }
}
```

- If a reference variable is assigned `null`, any method call on it will result in a `NullPointerException`.
- As `c` is an *instance variable*, when `d` is destroyed, `c` is also destroyedâ€”demonstrating **association**.

### Terminology

- **Container Object**: An object that holds another object as its data member.
  - Also known as *Source* or *Dependent*.
- **Contained Object**: An object that exists as a data member of another object.
  - Also known as *Component*, *Target*, *Independent*, or *Destination*.

### Types of Association

- **Composition**: Strong Has-A relationship.
  - The existence of the component object is **entirely dependent** on the existence of the container object.
- **Aggregation**: Weak Has-A relationship.
  - The existence of the component object is **partially dependent** on the existence of the container object.
